Hopefully it's pretty neat.

Oh yeah if you have some callbacks with the uri's like:
/test/[*]
/test/123
the 123 would over write the [*] or vice versa the other way.
you should only end with [*] and not have anything matching the previous with something at that level
/test/123/[*]
/test/126/12345
would work as the second level is different
